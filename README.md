Random anonymous private chat with Google firebase, Admob Ad implmented android java 8 ready to publish project targeting android 13 starting from android 5. 

This project is implmented professionally with clear and smart coding style. It has modern decent unique UI and UX.

This android project has ability to send not only text, but also any type of files both transferred sent encrypted and removed when the chat is closed. 

It uses anonymous login functionality, so no body will ever be able to know who you really are. 

No data is stored in the database other that the last message and files sent to you till the chat is closed, after then everything will be removed automatically. 

Here are some of the most interesting features this project have :

## How does this work?

When you first open the app, you will be logged in to the app anonymous with new user ID if you haven't opened the app before. After then when the next activity starts, first you will be online and counted for every other user online, and the app add listener to listen for newMessage, newChat, chatClose, events using the FirebaseHelper class that made everything super simple and easy to work with.

When you click I am ready, you will be ready for every user online and counted, then immediately a timer for time interval picked random from 1000ms to 5000ms, when the timer is called and no chat has started yet by another user doing the same thing with less timer interval, the app will randomly select ready users to connect and voil√†, you will be connected successfully.

Then you can talk, send files or do anything you like and, as I have mentioned above the chat is encrypted and only your last message is stored temporarily on firebase server, you can leave the chat anytime. When the chat is closed the files int the chat will be all removed automatically.

FirebaseStorageHelper, FirebaseHelper, ColorHelper, AdFather, and other class are very helpful for your other projects as well, I personally use them in every app i built, they are very helpful and easy to implment and to work with anywhere.

You can try the output app, it is in the zip file.
